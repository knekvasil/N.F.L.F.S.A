# N.F.L.F.S.A

The National Football League Fixture Statistics Aggregator.

### Data Structure

In the script's current state, it produces a JSON file in the format:

```
{
   "<Week #>":[
      {
         "<Fixture Id>": {
            "player_data": {
               "<player_id>": {...},
               "<player_id>": {...},
               ...
            },
            "fixture_data": {
               "home_stat": {...},
               "vis_stat": {...}
            },
            "pbp_data": [
               {
                  "details": "...",
                  "players": [
                     ("<player_id>", "<player_name>"),
                     ("<player_id>", "<player_name>"),
                     ...
                  ]
               }
            ]
         }
      },
      {
         "<Fixture Id>": {
            "player_data": {
               "<player_id>": {...},
               "<player_id>": {...},
               ...
            },
            "fixture_data": {
               "home_stat": {...},
               "vis_stat": {...}
            },
            "pbp_data": [
               {
                  "details": "...",
                  "players": [
                     ("<player_id>", "<player_name>"),
                     ("<player_id>", "<player_name>"),
                     ...
                  ]
               }
            ]
         }
      },
      ...
   ]
}
```

Currently, data is only grabbed per individual week, but functionality can easily be expanded to process multiple weeks or years at a time.

Due to necessary `sleep()` functions embedded in the code, this script will be too slow to be called from within another program and should be run independently.
